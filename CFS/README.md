Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) ImplementationThis repository contains a C implementation of the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), the default process scheduler used in the Linux kernel. The simulation models how the kernel balances CPU time among processes using a weighted fair-queuing approach.Core ConceptsVirtual Runtime ($vruntime$)CFS tracks the "virtual" time a process has spent on the CPU. The scheduler always selects the process with the smallest $vruntime$ to execute next.High Priority: $vruntime$ increases slowly, granting more CPU time.Low Priority: $vruntime$ increases quickly, leading to less CPU time.Red-Black Tree Data StructureTo manage processes efficiently, CFS uses a Red-Black Tree. This self-balancing binary search tree allows for $O(\log N)$ insertions and $O(1)$ retrieval of the process with the minimum $vruntime$.Technical DetailsScheduling LogicSelection: rb_extract_min picks the process with the lowest $vruntime$.Calculation: calc_slice determines the time quantum based on the process weight and total active tasks.Update: After execution, update_vruntime increments the process's timeline.Rebalancing: If the process is not finished, rb_insert places it back into the tree. The tree maintains balance through left_rotate and right_rotate operations.FormulasTime Slice: $Time\ Slice = \frac{Period \times Weight}{Total\ Weight}$vruntime Update: $\Delta vruntime = \Delta Actual\ Time \times \frac{Base\ Weight}{Process\ Weight}$Simulation OutputThe program provides detailed execution feedback:Gantt Chart: A visual timeline of process execution slices.Process Metrics: A table calculating Turnaround Time (TAT), Waiting Time (WT), and Response Time (RT).Averages: Summary statistics to evaluate the efficiency and fairness of the scheduling period.
