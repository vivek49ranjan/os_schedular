Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) SimulationThis implementation provides a C-based simulation of the Completely Fair Scheduler, the primary process scheduling algorithm in the Linux kernel. It utilizes a Red-Black Tree to achieve efficient task management and fairness.Technical OverviewThe CFS replaces traditional multilevel feedback queues with a timeline-based approach. It tracks the virtual runtime ($vruntime$) of each process, representing the amount of CPU time the process has received. The goal of the scheduler is to balance this $vruntime$ across all active tasks.Key ComponentsVirtual Runtime ($vruntime$): A normalized measure of CPU usage. Processes with higher priority (greater weight) accumulate $vruntime$ more slowly than lower-priority tasks.Red-Black Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree used to store tasks. This structure ensures that inserting a task and finding the task with the minimum $vruntime$ both occur in $O(\log n)$ time.Time Slicing: Instead of fixed quanta, time slices are calculated dynamically based on the formula:$$\text{slice} = \frac{\text{SCHED\_PERIOD} \times \text{weight}}{\text{Total Weight of Active Tasks}}$$Core LogicSelection: The scheduler calls rb_extract_min() to retrieve the task with the smallest $vruntime$.Execution: The task runs for its calculated slice or until its burst time is exhausted.Update: The update_vruntime() function adjusts the task's timeline based on its actual execution time.Rebalancing: If the task requires more time, it is re-inserted into the tree via rb_insert(). The tree performs rotations (left_rotate or right_rotate) to maintain its properties.Metrics and ReportingUpon completion, the simulation outputs:Gantt Chart: A visual timeline showing process execution and context switches.Performance Table: Calculated metrics for each PID, including:Turnaround Time (TAT): Total time from arrival to completion.Waiting Time (WT): Total time spent in the ready queue.Response Time (RT): Time from arrival to the first execution.
